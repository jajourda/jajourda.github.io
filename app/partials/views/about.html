	<h1>Joshua Andrew Jourdain</h1>
	<p> <strong>Kind of a freak, doing (and enjoying) <em>BOTH</em> programming and graphic design.</strong>I am passionate about pushing the limits of my skills, and growing through challenge. My work thus far has been rewarding, and I aim to move towards my goal of using my talents to pursue unique projects that are meaningful beyond a bottom line. I am excited to add to my growing knowledge base from experienced entrepreneurs how to cast vision for enterprises, how to navigate moving a company forward, and how to be a better leader.</p>
