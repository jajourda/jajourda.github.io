	<h1>Joshua Andrew Jourdain</h1>
	<p>I love to create. I have since I was a little boy. Drawings, and stories, and superheros galore. This passion was honed into a discipline when I entered the Charleston County School of the Arts as Visual Arts major in the sixth grade. For seven years, until my graduation, for at least 100 minutes a day I was perfecting these skills. Today, now a man with a little ones of my own, the passion has never died. </p>
	<p> My skill set is a bit perplexing, <strong>doing (and enjoying) BOTH programming and graphic design.</strong>The manifold challenges posed by creating for the web are nothing more than the contours and textures of a canvas. They are just stepping stones that help shape the final piece.  My work thus far has been rewarding, and I aim to continue doing rewarding work. My personal goal is to use my talents to pursue unique projects that are meaningful beyond a bottom line. That said, I am equally passionate and excited about learning from seasoned leaders in my field how to cast vision for enterprises, how to navigate moving a company forward as an entrepreneur, and how to be a better leader.</p>
